OVERVIWE OF THE PROJECT

Project : AUTOMATION FRAMEWORK WITH TESTNG AND 


Objective:

The objective of this project is to develop an automation framework using TestNG and Selenium to automate the testing of the web application. This framework will help in understanding how to structure and manage automated tests effectively, and ensure that the application's functionalities are tested thoroughly.


Key Activities: 


1. Environment Setup:

Install JDK and configure the environment.

Install Eclipse IDE.

Set up Selenium WebDriver and TestNG in the Eclipse project.



2. Framework Development:

Create a base class for WebDriver setup and teardown.

Develop page classes using the Page Object Model (POM) for various pages in the application.

Create test classes to write test cases.



3. Script Development:

Write scripts to automate user interactions such as login, navigation, form submission, and checkout process.

Use explicit waits to handle dynamic elements and improve script reliability.



4. Test Execution:

Run the test scripts using TestNG.

Verify the results and make necessary adjustments.



5. Reporting:

Integrate TestNG reporting features to generate test execution reports.




Technologies Used:


Java: Programming language used for writing the test scripts.

Selenium WebDriver: Tool used for automating web application testing.

TestNG: Testing framework used for writing and managing test cases.

Eclipse IDE: Integrated Development Environment used for writing and running the code.

ChromeDriver: WebDriver for automating Google Chrome browser.



Project Structure


Base Class:
Manages WebDriver initialization and teardown.


Page Classes:
Represent different pages of the application and contain methods to interact with web elements.


Test Classes:
Contain test cases written using TestNG.


Other Considerations

1.Scalability: The framework should be designed to easily add new test cases and pages as the application evolves.

2.Maintainability: Use the Page Object Model to keep the code modular and maintainable.

3.Reporting: Implement detailed logging and reporting mechanisms to track test execution and results.

4.CI/CD Integration: Consider integrating the framework with CI/CD tools like Jenkins for continuous testing.
